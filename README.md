# 2023 Mobile Robot Grasping and Navigation Challenge
In 2023, we host the Mobile Robot Grasping and Navigation Challenge that evaluates the robot's ability of scene understanding, navigation and grasping in the household scenario. The robot needs to explore a random environment, find a specific object and provide a stable grasp. CCF TCIR as the organizing committee launched the challenge. In this challenge, the organizer provides a downloadable simulator and an online evaluation system. Participants can develop their own scene understanding, navigation and grasping algorithms to complete the tasks. For more details, see https://homepage.robotmani-challenge.com/.
